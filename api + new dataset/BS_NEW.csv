For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $$$1$$$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $$$(x, y)$$$ and $$$(x, y+1)$$$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $$$(x', y)$$$ and $$$(x', y+1)$$$ for some $$$x'$$$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $$$x$$$, $$$x+1$$$ and the differing coordinate $$$y$$$.For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler: <center> <img class=""tex-graphics"" src=""/predownloaded/cd/ed/cded20992c4146e18e3511dc7d53ef82335523a5.png"" style=""max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;""/> </center>After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide: <center> <img class=""tex-graphics"" src=""/predownloaded/80/df/80dffb44e0814301d2ad11f4070b155b39148bf7.png"" style=""max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;""/> </center>If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler: <center> <img class=""tex-graphics"" src=""/predownloaded/57/bb/57bb3a91d0b7524c03e601c40ab6aea05afbe70f.png"" style=""max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;""/> </center>After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide: <center> <img class=""tex-graphics"" src=""/predownloaded/c3/89/c3894430fdab6a80e512b0f85b2f9ebdd0e44e58.png"" style=""max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;""/> </center>Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide.

But the boy didn't lose the high spirits and decided to play touch and run with himself. You may ask: ""How did he do that?"" The answer is simple.Vasya noticed that the yard is a rectangular <span class=""tex-span""><i>n</i> × <i>m</i></span> field. The squares have coordinates <span class=""tex-span"">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span> (<span class=""tex-span"">1 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ <i>n</i>, 1 ≤ <i>y</i> ≤ <i>m</i></span>), where <span class=""tex-span""><i>x</i></span> is the index of the row and <span class=""tex-span""><i>y</i></span> is the index of the column.Initially Vasya stands in the square with coordinates (<span class=""tex-span""><i>x</i><sub class=""lower-index""><i>c</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub class=""lower-index""><i>c</i></sub></span>).

After the boy has chosen a current vector, he makes the maximally possible number of valid steps in the vector's direction (it is possible that he makes zero steps).A <span class=""tex-font-style-it"">step</span> is defined as one movement from the square where the boy is standing now, in the direction of the current vector. That is, if Vasya is positioned in square <span class=""tex-span"">(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span>, and the current vector is <span class=""tex-span"">(<i>dx</i>, <i>dy</i>)</span>, one step moves Vasya to square <span class=""tex-span"">(<i>x</i> + <i>dx</i>, <i>y</i> + <i>dy</i>)</span>.
